This folder presents the code, input data, generated data, images and tables used and produced by running a weight quantization small language model. The gpt1.py file takes the code from https://github.com/karpathy. The file GPTQA.py modifies that code in order to implement weights quantization. The code has still to be modified in order to be more comprehensible.
